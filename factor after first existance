input :
5 2
1 2 4 5 6
ouput:
 2
 explanation:
 after 2 the two number that have factors as 2 are 4 and 6
 so the count is 2
 if again again 2 comes it should not be counted


#Your code below
a,b=map(int,input().split())
l,c=[int(i) for i in input().split()],0
if b not in l:
    print("0")
else:
    for i in range(l.index(b)+1,a):
        if l[i]%b==0 and l[i]!=b:
            c+=1
    print(c)
