explanation:
first prime numbers are printed in ascending order
then odd and  then even by ascending order

code:
l,l2=[int(i) for i in input().split()],[]
l.sort()
for i in l:
    if i>1:
        for j in range(2,i):
            if i%j==0:
                break
        else:l2.append(i)
for i in l:
    if i%2!=0 and i not in l2:l2.append(i)
for i in l:
    if i%2==0 and i not in l2:l2.append(i)
for i in l2:print(i,end=" ")
